This directory contains the Eagle files for the daughter boards.
I believe it contains all of the files needed.

If you have trouble opening them, I recommend you fire up my old
laptop, log in as me, and fire up eagle.

There is a transparency for the most recent version of the board in the cabinets in the office near other electronics.  But if you re-do this, I recommend you send the design files to a PCB fab house anyways.

Notes:

*The text in the copper layer was too small
*I was intimidated by the parts size and never got around
to actually populating the magnetometer on the board
*On boards without through holes, soldering the vias is a pain in the ass. That's the main reason you should go to a real fab house.


Cheers,
Andrew
