The pdf file is the model of encoder we used.

The rest was designed in Solid Edge; you sould look to that for anything non-obvious.

Note on disassembly:
* Disassembling the line angle sensor is not for the faint of heart
* We don't have a proper seal on the bottom; the whole thing is just packed with grease.  You will make a horrible mess; don't attempt without a shitload of paper towels.
* The magnetic rings on the aksim sensors are EXTREMELY delicate!  Make sure you remove the read heads completely before disassembling things.
* The height of the readheads must be carefully adjusted with screws.  The arrangement I have allows for arbitrarily fine adjustment, so don't change it without good reason.

*Adjusting the bearing load isn't too bad.  Just be aware that the lock nut on the bottom has one or two worm screws that must be loosened before turning it.

*Remeber, bearings are extremely sensitive to grit getting inside.  You should clean off your table and your hands and any crap on the outside of the device before even getting started.

*Make sure not to flip any of the roller bearings around!  The race angle matters and is an important part of the design.

*The race of the bearing that the upper magnetic ring is mounted on is just loc-tited to the shaft.  Hopefully you won't have to disassemble that far!  And sorry we couldn't come up with something better.  Note, that bearing race isn't actually under any load, aside from the bearing friction.

* The tension in the elevation cable can be adjusted by moving the bracket with the two pulleys downwards, but this also affects alignment of the cord with the races in the horizontal pulley.

Good luck!
