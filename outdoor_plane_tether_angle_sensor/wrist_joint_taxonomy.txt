Concept :
Use an off-the shelf universal joint, and add encodrs or potentiometes to the joints.

I didn't find a universal joint that I consdered suitable for modification.

* There are two sets of bearings.  
* If tether is suppoted by one of the clevises, both are loaded all the time.

A typical universal joint more or less has a construction of:
clevis > cross < clevis

The signs indicate which side of the joint is wider.

If we chose a "stationary" side, there are thus four possible vaiations on this mechanism to be considered:

SC = "Stationay Clevis"
MC = "Moving Clevis"

1. SC > cross < MC (
