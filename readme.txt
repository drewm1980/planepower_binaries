These are as many of the HIGHWIND carousel 2 design files 
as I could gather.

The CAD files will need to be openend with an academic version
of Solid Edge; at the time of writing commercial versions won't
open them.

The PCB schematics for the beaglebone daughter card are in eagle.

The rest is mostly just random .pdf files and such.

If something is missing, e-mail me at drewm1980@gmail.com,
and I will see if I can find it in a mirror of my home
directory.

Good luck guys!

Andrew
